```
## 🎯 Usage
### Basic Configuration
Modify the ticker symbols and date range in the notebook:

```python
tickers = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'TSLA']  # Add your stocks
start_date = "2023-01-01"
end_date = "2025-10-16"  # yfinance handles future dates gracefully
```

### Key Workflow
1. Data Acquisition: Automated fetching from Yahoo Finance
2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, validate data integrity
3. Quantitative Analysis: Calculate key performance indicators
4. Visualization: Generate professional charts and insights
5. Export Results: Save cleaned data and visualizations

### Customizing Analysis
Extend the analysis by modifying the src modules:

```python
# Add custom metrics in data_analysis.py
def max_drawdown(returns):
    """Calculate maximum portfolio drawdown"""
    cumulative = (1 + returns).cumprod()
    running_max = cumulative.expanding().max()
    drawdown = (cumulative - running_max) / running_max
    return drawdown.min()
```
### 📈 Sample Outputs
- **Cumulative Returns Chart**: Visualize investment growth over time
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Identify diversification opportunities
- **Risk-Return Scatter Plot**: Compare security performance profiles
- **Volatility Analysis**: Understand price fluctuation patterns

## 🔧 Technical Details
### Dependencies
Core packages include:
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- yfinance: Financial market data download
- matplotlib: Static visualizations
- seaborn: Statistical data visualization

### Modular Architecture
The project uses a scalable, enterprise-ready structure:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data, analysis, and visualization in separate modules
- **Reusability**: Functions can be imported into other projects
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend functionality
- **Testing Ready**: Modular design facilitates unit testing

### 💡 Interpretation Guide
Sharpe Ratio
- >1.0: Good risk-adjusted returns
- >2.0: Excellent performance
- >3.0: Exceptional portfolio management

### Correlation
- >0.7: High correlation (limited diversification benefits)
- 0.3 - 0.7: Moderate correlation
- <0.3: Low correlation (strong diversification potential)

## 🚀 Advanced Applications
### Portfolio Optimization
Use the correlation matrix and Sharpe ratios to:
- Identify optimal asset allocation
- Balance risk and return objectives
- Construct efficient frontiers

### Risk Management
- Monitor volatility thresholds
- Set stop-loss levels based on historical drawdowns
- Stress test portfolio under different market conditions
